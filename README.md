# PrintHero

Tiny library for convenience and especially to save the precious time of your life for better things, and your joints from abuse, and your wrists.

Mostly this library is just a few macros, like "#define sp(v) Serial.print(v)" "#define spl(v) Serial.println(v)", but some other good things are here too.
